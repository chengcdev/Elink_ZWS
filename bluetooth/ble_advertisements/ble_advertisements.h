 *  BLE Vendor Specific Device
 *
 * Features demonstrated
 *  - GATT database and Device configuration initialization
 *  - Processing user command over UART to control BLE Advertisements.
 *  - Demonstrate advertisement type and filter policy by UART command line.
 *
 *   To demonstrate the demo, work through the following steps.
 *   1. Plug the MiCOKit board into your computer, open a serial terminal
 *   2. Build and download the application (to the MiCOKit board)
 *   3. Type command "advert start" and "advert stop" on serial terminal to control
 *      BLE Advertisements.
 *   4. Turn on your a Central device and connect to this borad. This Central device
 *      is added to the white list now.
 *   5. Disconnect and re-advert.
 *   6. Type command "policy" on serial terminal to control BLE Advertisements
 *      filter policy - using white list or not. You can
 *   7. Now you can observe the filter policy.
 *   8. Type command "wlsize" to get a size of white list.
